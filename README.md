# Dart:  Improved Error Handling in Asynchronous Operations
This example showcases a common issue in Dart asynchronous programming and how to resolve it.

**Problem:** The original code uses a generic `catch` block which makes debugging difficult.  It doesn't distinguish between different types of errors (network, JSON parsing, etc.).  Error reporting is minimal.

**Solution:** The improved version separates the `catch` block to handle different error types. It also logs more detailed error information, which is crucial for debugging and monitoring production applications.  It provides more informative error messages to the user.
